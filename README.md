## Development Notes

### Prerequisties

**Node**

Before you can install Node, you'll need to install two other applications. Fortunately, once you've got these on your machine, installing Node takes just a few minutes.[1]

**MAC OS**

> - **XCode** Apple's XCode development software is used to build MAC and iOS apps, bit it also includes the tools you need to compile software for use on your Mac. XCode is free and you can find it in the Apple App Store.
>
> * Via Terminal `xcode-select --install`
>
> * **Homebrew** Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac - it makes installing most open source software(like Node) as simple as writing `brew install node`
> * To install Homebrew just open the Terminal and type `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`. You'll see messages in the Terminal explaining what you need to do to complete the installation process. Now type `brew install node`.

**Windows Installation Steps**[2]

> - Download the Windows installer from the [Node.js&copy;](http://nodejs.org/) web site.
> - Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
>
> * Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
> * Restart your computer. You wonâ€™t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.

**MySQL Workbench**

- It is recommended that you install MySQL Workbench v5.7 as it seems to be the most stable for all systems.

#### Windows

- Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html and download the version that matches your architecture.

#### MacOS

- Follow the instructions found here: [MacOS MySQL Workbench Installation](public/assets/readme/mysqlinstall_mac.md).
